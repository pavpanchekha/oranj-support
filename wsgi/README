Oranj-WSGI: WSGI interface for oranj
====================================

Oranj (http://wiki.github.com/pavpanchekha/oranj) is a pythonic,
dynamic programming language.  WSGI is a python technology that allows
for the embedding of python code within a web server (through CGI,
FastCGI, or a server-specific module, such as Apache's
mod_wsgi). Oranj-WSGI seeks to extend this technology to oranj
scripts.

Oranj-WSGI allows for basic server features, such as debugging
messages, directory listings, access management and rewrite rules.
